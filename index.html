        The Pinyin Toolkit is a plugin for the <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>, which adds
        a ton of features useful to learners of Mandarin Chinese.

        <h3>Definitions at your fingertips</h3>
        <!-- Only now explain what it's actually about -->
        <p>
          Thanks to the hard work of the folks at the <a href="http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/">CEDICT projects</a>, Pinyin Toolkit
          has great support for automatically looking up the definitions of words in both English and German, and limited support
          for French.

        <h3>Learn in any language of the world</h3>
        <p>
          To supplement its built in dictionaries, the  Toolkit is able to use <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a>
          to supply missing definitions. By leveraging the same technology, the Toolkit is able to look up the definitions of Chinese
          words and phrases in <i>any</i> other language supported by Google - conveniently and automatically from within the
          familiar Anki interface.

        <img class="miniscreen" src="images/screenshots/colorisation.png" />
        <h3>Make use of your visual memory</h3>
        <p>
          The Pinyin Toolkit automatically colorises Hanzi and pinyin in its automatically generated readings
          and meanings with a color corresponding to the tone that should be used in pronunciation.  Because this
          turns tonal information into visual information, visual learners can use this feature to greatly improve
          their recall of tones.  The colors chosen follow the <a href="http://laowaichinese.net/color-coded-tones-on-mdbg.htm">standard
          set by MDBG</a> for ease of interoperability, but you can customise them if you want.

        <h3>Listen as well as read</h3>
        <p>
          The Toolkit has great support for automatically generating basic Mandarin text-to-speech by stringing together
          samples from freely-available collections of Mandarin speech. <i>Listening</i> to the tone information in addition to reading
          it reinforces your understanding of the tones and eases the tricky task of remembering them.

      <div class="feature">
        <img class="miniscreen" src="images/screenshots/measurewords.png" />
        <h3>Pick out the measure words for separate study</h3>
        <p>
          As well as inserting the appropriate measure words for a noun automatically into the meaning, the Pinyin Toolkit is able to
          break the measure word information out into a separate field. This makes it easier for you to give them special attention
          during revision, and helps you adhere to the <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">minimum information principle<a>
          when formulating your cards.

        <h3>See how your knowledge of characters has improved over time</h3>
        <p>
          The Pinyin Toolkit augments the range of standard Anki visualisations with a fantastic new one for learners of Chinese. Using the Hanzi
          Graph, you are able to see graphically how far you have come towards each <a href="http://www.hsk.org.cn/english/default.aspx">HSK</a>
          level, and how your knowledge of the Chinese characters has improved over time.
