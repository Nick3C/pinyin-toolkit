These audio files were produced by Ya Li Cheng for the Gradint program in June 2008.
Sound editing was done by Cameron Wong (developer of the Ekho speech synthesizer) and
Silas Brown, using Audacity and Praat.

The files were converted from RAW audio to MP3 in February 2010 by Nicholas Cook and are now
distributed with the Pinyin Toolkit (a plug-in for Anki by Nicholas Cook and Max Bolingbroke).
Some of the audio files originally included with Gradint are not necessary in Pinyin Toolkit and are not included in this release.
