To use your own audio files create a subdirectory here and copy your files into it.
Pinyin Toolkit will use them automatically.

Pinyin Toolkit comes with sample audio and you can get another set by downloading it from within the preferences window. This should be adequate for most needs.

For details on how to get better quality audio you can read the information at:
